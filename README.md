# My Awesome Project
A React x Expo Go application to assist coaches in taking player statistics and provide a practice plan builder tool option.


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, React, Expo Go, HTML, CSS, Firebase DB

Started off creating an Expo Go x React application that is currently aimed towards a web application, but has the flexibility to eventually become a moblie app. I created a Firebase Database and started with connecting the authentication to the Login screen of this app! 

## Optimizations

Eventually this application can be extended to other sports! 

## Lessons Learned:

Used an Expo Go template that created extra unnecessary code, resulting in an initial messy code base. Requiring a clean-up session to remove this redundant code. 
- Take away: use a simpler template to save time later.
